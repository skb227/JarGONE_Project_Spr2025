            <h1>Welcome to JarGone's Legal Aid Services</h1>
            <p>We understand how difficult it is to understand legal jargon and terms, especially when most
                of us were never taught how to read through these documents. We aim to provide a service that 
                helps anyone better understand their legal documents and troubles. You can upload a document
                or talk with out chat box to translate or explain components of your legal documents that are 
                causing you trouble. We want to help limit the social injustices that plague our current legal 
                system.
