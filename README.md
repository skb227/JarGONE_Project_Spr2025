#  Legal Jargon Aid

### Mission
We understand how difficult it is to understand legal jargon and terms, especially when most of us were never taught how to read through such documents. Our services aims to provide help to anyone to better understand their legal documents and troubles. You can upload a document to translate to another language or explain tricky components and terminology of the legal document. Our hope with this project is to help limit the social injustices that plague our current legal system, which disproportionately affect certain communities.
